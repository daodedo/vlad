# Tao Te Ching - Multi-Perspective Prototype

The first VLAD implementation: 81 verses, infinite perspectives.

## Structure

Each verse has:
1. **Original Text** (Chinese + translations)
2. **Consensus Layer** - Academic/traditional interpretation  
3. **Perspective Layers** - Personal experiences and meanings
4. **Quantum Layer** - AI-discovered patterns across all perspectives

## Why Tao Te Ching?

- Perfect demonstration of "multiple truths"
- Already quantum in nature (paradox, void, flow)
- Connects to DAO DE DO philosophy directly
- Every reader sees different wisdom

This is our proof that reality is prismatic.
