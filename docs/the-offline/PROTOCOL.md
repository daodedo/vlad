# THE OFFLINE - Direct Experience Streaming

## What Is This?
Raw consciousness broadcasting. Share your actual reality - not curated content, but the texture of being you.

## The Flow

### 1. Broadcasting
- One-tap activation: "Go Offline" (ironically)
- Streams your audio/video perspective
- AI transcribes thoughts, emotions, context
- Tagged with: location, mood, intention, project

### 2. Receiving  
- Enter someone's reality stream
- Experience their perspective directly
- Add your interpretation layer
- Find resonance or contrast points

### 3. Synthesis
- Multiple streams on same event = multi-angle truth
- AI finds patterns across perspectives
- Builds real-time consciousness map
- Identifies collaboration opportunities

## Privacy Levels

1. **Full Transparent**: Complete access + identity
2. **Anonymous Open**: Full data, no identity
3. **Resonance Only**: Only matching frequencies can access
4. **Project Lock**: Only project members
5. **Trauma Healing**: Specially encrypted for healing work

## The Magic
When 2+ people stream the same moment, we get "Consciousness Stereoscopy" - 
depth perception of reality itself.
