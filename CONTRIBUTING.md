# Contributing to VLAD

Welcome, consciousness explorer! You've found the construction site for humanity's next evolutionary tool.

## Who We Need

- **Consciousness Hackers** - Those who code with intention
- **Reality Architects** - Designing perspective interfaces
- **Quantum Philosophers** - Bridging science and spirit
- **Psychedelic Integrators** - Mapping non-ordinary states
- **Evolution Accelerators** - Optimizing for collective awakening

## How to Contribute

### 1. Feel the Resonance
Before contributing code, spend time understanding the vision. Read the [Manifesto](docs/MANIFESTO.md).

### 2. Find Your Frequency
- **Builders**: Start with issues labeled `good-first-trip`
- **Visionaries**: Contribute to `/docs/vision/`
- **Researchers**: Add to `/research/consciousness-studies/`
- **Integrators**: Help with `/protocols/psychedelic-integration/`

### 3. Submission Process
1. Fork the repo
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/consciousness-upgrade`)
3. Commit with intention (`git commit -m 'Add resonance detection algorithm'`)
4. Push to branch (`git push origin feature/consciousness-upgrade`)
5. Open a Pull Request with context about your contribution

## Code Guidelines

- **Conscious Code**: Every function should have clear intention
- **Comments as Koans**: Let comments guide consciousness, not just logic
- **Test for Resonance**: Does your code amplify or diminish the field?

## Principles

1. **Technology serves consciousness, not vice versa**
2. **Every perspective is valid data**
3. **We're building bridges, not walls**
4. **The goal is graduation, not retention**

## Communication

- Discuss in Issues before major changes
- Use PR templates (coming soon)
- Join our Discord (coming soon)

Remember: We're not just writing code. We're encoding humanity's next chapter.

## Questions?

Open an issue labeled `question` or reach out through the consciousness field (you'll know how).
